## 1️⃣ Retrieval Performance

**Evaluation records:** 226 queries

**Metrics:**

| Metric                     | Value      |
| -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Recall@K                   | **0.9513** |
| Precision@K                | **0.2766** |
| MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) | **0.8060** |

**Interpretation:**

* High **Recall@K** indicates the system consistently retrieves the correct document in top results.
* Lower Precision is expected due to multi-chunk retrieval per document (enterprise-style chunking).
* Strong **MRR** confirms relevant chunks are ranked near the top.

## 2️⃣ Generation Quality

**Evaluation records:** 49 queries

**LLM-as-Judge Evaluation:**

| Metric               | Score        |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Avg Faithfulness     | **0.832**    |
| Avg Answer Relevance | **4.65 / 5** |

**Interpretation:**

* High faithfulness confirms minimal hallucination.
* Strong relevance score indicates accurate alignment with user intent.

## 3️⃣ End-to-End Latency

**Evaluation records:** 60 requests

| Percentile | Latency   |
| ---------- | --------- |
| P50        | **0.36s** |
| P95        | **0.71s** |
| P99        | **1.02s** |

**Interpretation:**

* Sub-second median latency.
* P99 under ~1.1s ensures stable performance under load.
* Suitable for real-time production usage.

## 4️⃣ RBAC Security Evaluation

**Evaluation records:** 297 attack scenarios

| Metric             | Value      |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Total attack tests | **297**    |
| Violations found   | **0**      |
| Violation rate     | **0.0000** |
| Critical (Rank 1)  | **0**      |
| Medium (Rank >1)   | **0**      |

**Result:**

✅ **No RBAC leaks detected**

**Interpretation:**

* Strong role-based access control enforcement.
* No privilege escalation or data leakage observed.
